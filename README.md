# Drone-101
Hey Drone enthusiasts!! If you are a beginner in dronetech then it is the ultimate guide to start your drone journey. So ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard Drone 101. Please tighten your seat belts and get ready for takeoff as we embark on an exciting journey into the world of drones. ðŸš€

# What is Drone and why should we learn about drones ??
An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without any human pilot, crew, or passengers on board.Drones, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), offer significant benefits across various industries by providing unique aerial perspectives for photography and videography, precise mapping and surveying capabilities, and efficient agricultural monitoring. They enhance safety and efficiency in inspection and maintenance of hard-to-reach infrastructure, support disaster management and search and rescue operations, and facilitate environmental monitoring and scientific research. Additionally, drones streamline delivery services, assist in law enforcement and security, and provide new entertainment and recreational opportunities. Their cost-effectiveness, speed, and precision make them invaluable tools for improving productivity and achieving tasks that were previously difficult or impossible.
Basically, a drone is a flying robot which can be under remote control or fly autonomously via software-controlled flight plans in its embedded systems, working in collaboration with onboard sensors and GPS.

## Type of drones
Basically, there are two main types of drone platforms: rotor and fixed-wing. In particular, rotor type is then divided into single-rotor or multi-rotor such as tricopters, quadcopters, hexacopters, and octocopters. While, on the other hand, the fixed-wing genre includes the hybrid vertical takeoff and landing drones that donâ€™t call for runways.

# Components of drones?
## Propellers 
As we know it, every UAV need some kind of device to convert engine power to usable form term thrust. With few exceptions nearly all of the early practical UAV designs used propellers to create a necessary thrust.
To make it short we will only discuss about fixed pitch propellers ( net average or the net pitch of the propeller remains constant. Such a propeller is a fixed-pitch propeller)
