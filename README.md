# What is Drone and why should we learn about drones ??
An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), commonly known as a drone, is an aircraft without any human pilot, crew, or passengers on board.Drones, or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), offer significant benefits across various industries by providing unique aerial perspectives for photography and videography, precise mapping and surveying capabilities, and efficient agricultural monitoring. They enhance safety and efficiency in inspection and maintenance of hard-to-reach infrastructure, support disaster management and search and rescue operations, and facilitate environmental monitoring and scientific research. Additionally, drones streamline delivery services, assist in law enforcement and security, and provide new entertainment and recreational opportunities. Their cost-effectiveness, speed, and precision make them invaluable tools for improving productivity and achieving tasks that were previously difficult or impossible.
Basically, a drone is a flying robot which can be under remote control or fly autonomously via software-controlled flight plans in its embedded systems, working in collaboration with onboard sensors and GPS.

## Type of drones
Basically, there are two main types of drone platforms: rotor and fixed-wing. In particular, rotor type is then divided into single-rotor or multi-rotor such as tricopters, quadcopters, hexacopters, and octocopters. While, on the other hand, the fixed-wing genre includes the hybrid vertical takeoff and landing drones that don‚Äôt call for runways.

# Components of drones
## Propellers 
As we know it, every UAV need some kind of device to convert engine power to usable form term thrust. With few exceptions nearly all of the early practical UAV designs used propellers to create a necessary thrust.

A propeller normally consists of two or more blades attached to a central hub which ts mounted on a brushless DC motor or engine crankshaft. The purpose of the propeller is to convert rotation power to useful thrust. The blades, which are actually rotating wings have a leading edge, traillng edge, tip, shank, face and back as shown in Figures. The fixed-pitch propeller is the most Widely used propeller design in aviation. A fixed-pitch propeller may be made of wood, aluminum, or steel and is considered to be of one-piece construction with a blade angle that cannot normally be changed.

## Frame
A drone frame is the structural chassis or body of the drone that supports and holds all its components together, including the motors, propellers, flight controller, battery, and payload. The frame is typically made from materials like carbon fiber, aluminum, plastic, or composite materials, chosen for their strength, durability, and lightweight properties.
- Structural Integrity:
The frame provides the necessary strength and rigidity to withstand the forces and stresses experienced during flight, including impacts and vibrations. A well-designed frame ensures the drone remains stable and intact.
- Weight Management:
The frame‚Äôs material and design significantly influence the drone‚Äôs overall weight. A lightweight yet strong frame is essential for optimizing flight performance, increasing flight time, and enhancing maneuverability.
- Component Support and Protection:
The frame securely holds all the drone‚Äôs components in place, ensuring they function correctly. It also provides protection to sensitive parts like the flight controller, cameras, and sensors from damage during crashes or rough landings.
- Aerodynamics:
The frame design affects the drone‚Äôs aerodynamics, impacting its efficiency, stability, and speed. A streamlined frame reduces air resistance, allowing for smoother and more efficient flight.
- Customization and Modularity:
Many drone frames are designed to be modular, allowing for easy customization and upgrades. This flexibility enables users to add or replace components, such as different types of cameras, sensors, or payloads, to suit specific applications.
- Durability and Longevity:
A high-quality frame made from durable materials can extend the drone‚Äôs lifespan by withstanding wear and tear. This durability is crucial for drones used in demanding environments or for professional purposes.
- Safety:
A robust frame contributes to the overall safety of the drone by ensuring that critical components remain protected during operation. It also helps prevent parts from coming loose or getting damaged, which could lead to malfunctions or accidents.

## Brushless Motors -
A brushless DC motor (also known as a BLDC motor or BL motor) is an electronically commuted DC motor which does not have brushes. The controller provides pulses of current to the motor windings which control the speed and torque of the synchronous motor.
In reality, all the most recent drones utilize a brushless electric ‚Äúout-runner‚Äù genre, making it one of the essential components of a drone. This is more reliable, more efficient, and quieter compared to a brushed motor. Motor with higher efficiency not only saves battery life but also gives the operator more flying time.
 It uses an electronic controller to switch DC currents to the motor windings producing magnetic fields that effectively rotate in space and which the permanent magnet rotor follows. 
 For working principle of BLDC motor check out [BLDC](https://www.automate.org/motion-control/blogs/what-is-a-brushless-dc-motor-and-how-does-it-work#:~:text=A%20brushless%20DC%20motor%20is%20essentially%20flipped%20inside,stator%20to%20rotate%20the%20rotor%20a%20full%20360-degrees.)


**Understanding BLDC motor specifications**
Brushless motors use a standard numbering scheme to describe their physical size and Kv rating. For example: let's assume we have a 5055-3000Kv Brushless Outrunner Motor. We break the numbers out as follows:  [50] [55] - [3000]
- [50] The first two numbers represent the diameter of the motor's housing in millimeters; in this example 50mm
- [55] The second two numbers represent the length of the motor housing in millimeters; in this example 55mm
- [3000] The numbers after the dash represent the Kv rating of the motor; in this example 3000Kv. The Kv rating (not to be confused with kilo-volt) is the RPM of the motor (k) per volt (V) with no load. For example, a brushless motor with a Kv rating of 3000 powered by a 12V power source would be capable of 36,000 RPMs (multiply 3000x12). This is the max RPMs that this motor can reach under no load. A motor with a higher Kv will have more top end speed, but not as much acceleration/torque. A motor with a lower Kv will not be as fast, but will accelerate faster and have more torque.
**Note:**
- The ideal number of rpm of a motor for you is dependent on what type of copter you‚Äôre looking for. For example, if you‚Äôre looking for a high performance, acrobatic copter, a high rpm motor is the one for you, meaning of course a high Kv rating. This is intuitive because these acrobatic copters are generally of the smaller variety, meaning a smaller motor, leading to smaller propellers. When you have these smaller propellers, the motors need to produce more rpm in order to produce the necessary thrust. However, this means that these motors use up more power than others, and so are less efficient.
- On the other hand, if you would like your copter to use the least amount of power as possible, and so last longer and be more stable, then motors with lower rpm are ideal. An example for when these types of motors would be useful is in taking aerial photos. Again, this is partly due to the fact that the type of copters used for this these tasks are bigger in order to carry the necessary equipment, meaning larger propellers, which will create more thrust when rotated. They therefore require fewer rpm.
